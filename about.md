## About the Author

Every karmic experience is a chance to view a perspective from another time and space of our reality. Through my personal experiences, I wish to help others on their journey to understand who they are and what they might be going through.

Around 2012 Earth started to evolve and experience a higher form of reality. A less dense, but still very physical reality. I did not notice this shift  like most of us. We only noticed immediate chaos around us, what some might argue to be forms of spiritual awakening triggers. Twin flames, addiction, mental and physical abuse, loss and much more to name a few. I began to awaken to this evolution on July 18th, 2020. I describe it as flying before walking, similar to being thrown in the deep end first. The reason I describe it like this is due to the unexpected, overwhelming events that unfolded right after.

Growing up a “reserved catholic” the unexplainable had been attributed to God, ghosts, and your imagination. Your typical “woohoo voodoo nonsense”. For example, I had vividly seen a young boy in early 1900’s garments running past our stairs at the bottom of our basement. It felt playful, and I wasn’t scared. I went to my mom asking her who it was. Her explanation was good enough for my five year old self, the reflection of the TV is all it was. Looking back there wasn’t a TV near the stairs and this is one example of why what happened to me during the summer of 2020 was hard to fathom, but it didn't matter if I didn’t believe it, this was happening.

That day - while on a hike with my dog - I felt an undeniable almost creepy feeling that I was being followed through the woods. No, it was not someone else on the path behind me - but a Ghost? My mind was scrambling trying to come up with an explanation. I began getting tingling chills almost like I was vibrating. I could feel eyes watching me as I scanned the dense forest all around me looking for someone or something. As I continued I felt the presence become stronger and more powerful, almost like a deceased relative wanted to connect with me through the “spirit” world. I repeatedly thought to myself “what is going on?” beginning to notice it echo. My ears rang louder and louder sounding like a fierce falsetto hymn. Trying to tune in, I just felt so much power and love. 

At that moment, it’s hard to describe exactly, but I heard my subconscious saying my name slower over and over again. Almost like a yelling whisper. I knew the entire time that someone or something was connecting with me but I didn’t expect it to be like this. Leaving the forest, I was telepathically connected to myself in the future. The energy was so strong, it felt as if I was at 110%, and my future self was operating at 1%. I immediately noticed changes in my environmentI was connected to the akashics, able to feel energy all around me. After about 36 hours I crashed harder than I had ever. I felt drained, almost like an energy hangover. 

I went on to frequently connect with interdimensional entities in pairs of two which seemed to be  1 masculine and 1 feminine each time. They did not care to get into genders, names or specifics like this as they were constraints. Communicating by talking and mind visuals that play out like internet GIFS, they explained they were part of a collective consciousness paying attention to the evolution of our consciousness on earth. 

I went on to have two more experiences, both similar but different from the first. Nothing seemed to stop me, I was breaking down as many barriers as I could, until I wasn’t. It fell fast, and soon found myself doing months of shadow work - feeling no connection to the akashics, my new spirit guides, and most importantly my higher self.

Life seemed to be looping, and as I was reborn I began raising my energy and still am. I knew I wanted to write about my journey very early so I would not not forget any details and I feel now is the time. I will continue to break reality and see beyond.
