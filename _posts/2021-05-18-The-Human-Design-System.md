Alan Robert Krakower pioneered the Human Design System, originally publishing the novel The *Human Design System* under the alias "Ra Uru Hu". The book is very coming of age and includes the basics and more advanced topics, written from the perspective of Human Design cosmology. Whatever your belief, it is an interesting tool that combines astrology, I Chang, Kabbalah and the Chakras. For those interested,[you can purchase the book here](https://humandesignamerica.com/books/general-education/item/66-the-black-book).

Human Design uses the exact time, date and physical location of your birth to produce a body graph. This body graph includes the make up of your design type. The body graph analyses two moments of imprinting during our 9 month conception. One is taken at 88 degrees of the Sun before we are born, and the other at the instance of our actual physical birth. I like to think of this as our mission, and our purpose.

At these two moments the exact alignment of the Sun, Moon, Planets, South Node and North Node are captured according to your GPS location entered. With this, we are presented with a Design type of the 4 possible options. These are:

* Manifestors, 
* Generators, 
* Projectors and, 
* Reflectors

One of my favourite parts of the body graph is the in-depth *Gates*, which are thresholds to your center chakras. Depending on when you were born, you may have connecting gates resulting in Channels. Personally, I resonate with the channels I uncoverred in my human design and I can easily compare the channels to traits I have in my daily life.

I was able to complete my free body graph and receive my Design Type at the website here:[MyFreeBodygraph](https://www.mybodygraph.com/). Below is mine for those curious:

To give you an example of the Channels, I have my Head and Adjna centers connected to create the channel of awareness seen here:
