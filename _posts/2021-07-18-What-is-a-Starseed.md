Some of you might be wondering what a starseed exactly is and what it refers to. A starseed is a conscious soul that originally incarnated outside of earth. Starseeds have lived many incarnations on and outside of earth and our galaxy. 

I believe we are all starseeds, unless our purpose was to originally incarnate on earth as an Earth Soul and all your incarnations were on Earth. I believe Earth Souls are very rare, and many if not all of us are starseeds 

While the galaxy turns complexity into infinity, the starseeds turns time into sublime. Earth is a wonderful place to incarnate. For me, it feels like the greatest exploration I've been on but as a starseed it does not exactly feel like home. 

Starseeds chose to come to earth assisting in the aid of unity consciousness, and willingly forgetting their star origins. As if it were an excursion, you fall in love with your environment and still feel the need to take care of Earth.

Some say starseeds are advanced spiritual beings, but this is creating a perspective where some of us are not as advanced as others. We are all on our own paths, our own journeys, all as starseeds resonating at our own frequency. 

It is up to you to decide if you are a starseed. 

As always, believe only what you know to be true. There is no good or bad, no true or false - only the limitations you place on your mind. Be open minded while loving and accepting others, but think for yourself and learn from every experience.
