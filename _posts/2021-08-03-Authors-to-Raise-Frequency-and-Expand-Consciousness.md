### 1. Jane Roberts

Jane Roberts was born on May 8th, 1929 and passed away on September 5th, 1984. She was an author, psychic, medium and channeler. On December 2, 1963, Jane and her husband began to receive channelled messages from an energy agent identifying himself as Seth with the use of an Ouiji board. By January, Jane no longer needed the Ouiji board as she began to fully channel Seth through her physical being. She would enter a trance state as Seth would take control of her body and speak through her. When channelling Seth, Jane’s voice completely changed and took on a male Indian-like tone.

Seth described himself as an "energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter," and was independent of Roberts' subconscious. 

The information channelled from Seth was published in summary form as “The Seth Material”, written by Roberts from the recorded channelling sessions. From January 1970, Jane began writing more books through Seth and the series of "Seth books" totalled ten volumes.

Notable books:

* Seth Speaks
* The Nature Of Personal Reality
* The Seth Material
* Adventures In Consciousness

### 2. Carla Rueckert, Don Elkins, and James Allen McCarty (Ra Material)

The Ra Material is a collection of 26 channelling sessions of contact with and extraterrestrial conscious energy being “Ra”. This material was collected over 19 years, from 1962 to 1981. The information that makes up The Ra Material was channelled by Carla Rueckert while being written and edited by James Allen McCarty and Don Elkins. The team called their method of channelling a “tuned trance telepathy.”

The Law of One is the principle that everything in our universe is connected and all is one. Ra is a higher vibrational entity of multidimensional beings that helped with the construction of the pyramids back during ancient egyptian times. Ra notes channeling through Carla is the first time uninterrupted communication has been made by Ra in a long time in our third density. The material covers many big questions such as the meaning of life and also notes on other third-dimensional topics such as philosophy, spirituality and religion.

Lao Tzu, sometimes written as Laozi, was an ancient Chinese Philosopher and the founder of Taoism in China. Taosim translates to living in harmony with “the way” or source. Lao is most famous for his writing of the Tao Te Ching and is considered a legendary figure in the chinese spiritual culture. 

It is unknown exactly when he was born, but it is known that he lived sometime between 4th BCE and 6th BCE. Lao Tzu explains his ideas by way of analogies like many chinese philosophers. This allows the text to be interpreted slightly differently for each reader, but the common theme is that we have to be in balance with our self-awareness.

Notable books:
* Tao Te Ching
